# Creditcard Fraud Detection System. 

The detailed analysis of 

Algorithm Used:

1. [Simple Logistic regression](https://github.com/hvp004/creditcard-fraud-detection/blob/master/Linear-Regression.pdf)
2. [Logistic Regression with Undersampling](https://github.com/hvp004/creditcard-fraud-detection/blob/master/UnderSampling.pdf)
3. [Synthetic Minority Over Sampling Technique (SMOTE) with gini as the critertionn of best split.](https://github.com/hvp004/creditcard-fraud-detection/blob/master/SMOTE-gini.pdf) 
4. [Synthetic Minority Over Sampling (SMOTE) with entropy as the critertionn of best split.](https://github.com/hvp004/creditcard-fraud-detection/blob/master/SMOTE--Entropy.pdf)

Future work:
1. Result statistic tables.
2. Source code download links.
